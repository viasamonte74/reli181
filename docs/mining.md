# Running a Reliquary Miner

Operational guide for running a miner on Bittensor subnet 81. For conceptual background see [docs/concepts.md](concepts.md).

## Boot sequence

1. Miner starts with `reliquary mine --wallet-name ... --hotkey ...`
2. Discovers the validator's HTTP URL via the Bittensor metagraph (or uses `--validator-url` override).
3. Calls `GET /state` to read `checkpoint_repo_id` and `checkpoint_revision`.
4. If the validator has a published checkpoint, downloads it from Hugging Face and loads those weights.
5. Falls back to the required `--checkpoint` value (`Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base` for v6) if no checkpoint is published yet.
6. Enters the main loop in `MiningEngine.mine_window()`:
   - Poll `/state` every tick.
   - If `state.checkpoint_n > local_n`, download the new HF revision and reload both model copies.
   - If `state.state == OPEN`, pick a prompt, generate rollouts, and submit.

The boot query ensures a miner joining an already-running subnet lands directly on the current model, skipping an initial reject cycle.

`/state.generation_profile_id` and `/state.generation_contract` are
authoritative. The live protocol-v6 profile is
`qwen3-4b-base-dapo-reliquary-v1`. The reference miner refuses to generate
unless its active profile exactly matches the validator contract. Custom miners
should read `prompt_encoding`, `sampling`,
and each environment's `prompt_template`, `answer_format`, `max_new_tokens`,
and `bft` fields.

## What a miner does (protocol v6)

**A v6 window closes on fill, not on a clock.** There is no 100-second deadline
or seal-time auction. Each environment accumulates proven groups until it has
taken the configured number of 16-group picks (16 picks and 256 groups by
default). The 1800-second ceiling is a backstop for a window that never fills,
not a target, so a window can last minutes or half an hour depending on supply.

Two consequences for how you mine:

- **Proof is continuous, not deferred to a seal.** Groups are proven as they
  arrive rather than ranked top-down in one burst at a deadline.
- **Selection is FIFO.** Validator-observed throughput and payload size remain
  telemetry, but cannot move a group ahead of an earlier eligible group.
  Earlier arrival still has a residual advantage because the window closes on
  fill; removing that race requires a later protocol design, not another v6
  scoring knob.

Proven groups that no pick takes when the window closes **burn** — nothing
that skips the assembler is paid. There is no per-operator winner cap.

This FIFO/fixed-payment update does not change the miner wire or generation
contract: miners already using the live Reliquary V1 profile need no cutover.
Forced-seed protocol v6 remains mandatory and BFT remains disabled.

Every miner runs a continuous poll-submit loop:

1. **Polls `/state`.** The response (`GrpoBatchState`) carries `state`, `window_n`, `checkpoint_n`, `checkpoint_repo_id`, `checkpoint_revision`, `cooldown_prompts`, and (new in v2.3) **`randomness`** — the validator's per-window seed sourced from drand-quicknet + drand-round. Use it directly as the GRAIL r_vec seed; do **not** recompute it locally from `block_hash + drand` like v2.2 miners did. (`block_hash` was dropped from the v2.3 seed entirely — see the design spec for the reasoning).
   - If `state != "open"`, the validator is in `TRAINING` or `PUBLISHING`. Sleep briefly (1 s) and re-poll. Do not submit while the window is not open.
   - If `checkpoint_n` advanced since the last poll, download the new HF revision and reload weights.

2. **Picks a prompt.** Selects a `prompt_idx` from one active environment. OpenMath uses **OpenMathInstruct-2** ([`nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2), ~14 million problems, math-reasoning style) and local reward computation. OpenCode uses the public curated dataset (`R0mAI/opencodeinstruct-curated`) with validator-authoritative grading. In both cases, skip prompts in `cooldown_prompts`. The reference engine uses uniform-random sampling with rejection against the cooldown set. (v2.3 switched OpenMath from Hendrycks MATH because the 12 500-prompt env exhausted under one-shot cooldown — see "One-shot prompts" below.)

3. **Generates M=16 rollouts.** Runs exactly 16 completions with the repository's forced-seed sampler. The deterministic stream excludes hotkey identity and is derived from window randomness, prompt, checkpoint, rollout index, and token position. Set `protocol_version=6`, render the generation contract's exact step-by-step environment template, encode that canonical prompt as raw text (do not apply a chat template), use `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=1.0`, and `top_k=0`, terminate at the first configured EOS, and do not add a presence/repetition processor that the validator does not reproduce.

4. **Provides rollout rewards.** OpenMath miners compute `env.compute_reward(problem, completion_text)` locally and send that value as `rollout.reward`; the validator recomputes it and rejects mismatches. The v6 Math contract requires a valid final `\boxed{...}`/`\fbox{...}` answer. A completion without one scores zero, and the validator conservatively treats that outcome as uncertain when deciding zone eligibility, so removing a box cannot create useful variance. OpenCode is validator-authoritative: miners send placeholder rewards if the client shape requires them, and the validator recomputes the real code reward and overwrites local claims before the zone filter. Miners never run the grader.

5. **Builds GRAIL sketches.** Runs the bit-identical HuggingFace forward pass on the proof GPU to construct sketch commitments that bind the completions to the model. The r_vec seed **must** come from `state.randomness` exactly — local re-derivation will diverge from the validator's seed and the binding check rejects with `WRONG_RANDOMNESS`.

6. **Commits, then uploads.** Finalize the signed `BatchSubmissionRequest`,
   serialize it once, and compute its byte length and SHA-256. POST the small
   signed metadata to `/submit/precommit`, then POST those exact bytes to
   `/submit` with the returned `X-Reliquary-Precommit` receipt. A precommit
   grants at most 33 seconds for that exact reveal; it does not extend
   generation or reserve a slot. Under v6 the cutoff is 1767 s into the
   window — 33 s before the 1800 s backstop — but a window normally closes on
   fill long before that, so treat the cutoff as a ceiling, not a schedule.
   - Compute and sign the current quicknet round immediately before
     serialization. The validator applies zero backward tolerance and records
     drand at precommit arrival. Pre-baking the round at sketch-build time is
     wrong.
   - Do not rebuild, reformat, or re-sign the body after precommit. The receipt
     binds its SHA-256, byte count, routing fields, nonce, checkpoint, and
     protocol version. A same-sized substitution is rejected.
   - The reference submitter falls back to deadline-sensitive direct `/submit`
     only when an older validator returns 404 for `/submit/precommit`.

Under v6 there is no seal-time auction to win. The validator grades during
collection and proves continuously as budget allows. A group that proves
joins its environment's FIFO pick queue; a proven group no pick takes before
the window closes is unpaid.

The v5 tie-break on tokens per validator-observed round is gone. Submitted
drand is a freshness check, not an economic ordering key, and payload length
does not affect priority or payment. Faster generation can still reach FIFO
first; that remaining arrival race is explicit rather than hidden in a score.

### Prompt competition and payment

Up to `MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_PROMPT = 10` bounded pending groups may exist for one
prompt, but an operator can reserve only one logical claim for that prompt.
Eligible groups are proved and selected in FIFO order; a failed proof is
unpaid and the queue continues. Runners-up do not split emission.

Each selected group earns
`window_pool / (environment_count × picks_target × B_BATCH)`, independent of
completion length. Missing groups are not redistributed; their shares go to
the validator's configured burn UID.

### One-shot prompts

`BATCH_PROMPT_COOLDOWN_WINDOWS = 1_000_000` makes every prompt effectively single-use within any realistic training run. Once a prompt enters `winning_prompts`, it never returns. The 14M-prompt OpenMathInstruct-2 env supplies enough fresh material for roughly 875,000 windows at the current B = 16 cadence, which is well beyond any practical training horizon.

## Submission lifecycle — where your rollout actually ends up

The most common miner question is *"the validator returned `accepted=True`, but I earned no slot — what's going on?"* V6 has three lifecycle stages.

```
miner                 HTTP/worker admission             continuous proof/pick
-----                 ---------------------             ---------------------
POST precommit   ->   signed upload receipt             FIFO proof dispatch
POST exact body  ->   reason="submitted"                proof checks
                      cheap checks + grading            selected or unpaid
                      first ACCEPTED verdict            final verdict + reward
```

1. **HTTP enqueue.** `accepted=True reason="submitted"` means only that the request entered the worker queue.

2. **Pool admission.** The worker runs bounded schema, identity, reward, zone, and authenticity-independent checks. Its `ACCEPTED` verdict means your group is pending proof, not paid. Code grader infrastructure failures are not converted into zero rewards.

3. **Final result.** Continuous proof and FIFO selection publish a second verdict. A paid group has `selected_for_batch=true` and `rewarded=true`. An eligible group that the closing window never selects remains accepted but unpaid; a failed proof gets its actual rejection.

The R2 archive (`reliquary/dataset/window-<N>.json.gz`) contains selected rows,
rejections, policy identifiers, the exact reward map, and compatibility
candidate metadata.

### How to look up your specific submission

Per submission you have `(window_n, prompt_idx)`. Two lookup paths:

- **Dashboard drawer.** Click your hotkey row on `https://reliqua.ai/dashboard`. The drawer's "last 5w" table shows `sub / acc / soft / hard` counts per window for your hotkey, and when `hard > 0` it lists every rejection with its `prompt_idx`, reason, and the actual GRAIL diagnostic values (`sketch_diff`, `lp_dev`, `dist_q10`) that pushed it over threshold.
- **Raw archive.** `GET https://reliqua.ai/api/r2/window/<N>` returns the full window archive for any cached window. Search `batch[]`, `rejected[]`, and `difficulty_auction.<environment>.candidates[]` for your prompt and hotkey. Ingress evidence includes payload/body timing, precommit status, queue wait, reward grading, and admission commit time.

### Prompt selection strategy

The reference strategy (`pick_prompt_idx` in `reliquary/miner/engine.py`) is uniform-random sampling with rejection against the cooldown set:

```
GET /state  →  GrpoBatchState
```

- Read `cooldown_prompts` and pick any `prompt_idx` not in that set.
- Read `checkpoint_revision` and include it verbatim as `checkpoint_hash` in your submission.
- Read `window_n` and use it as the authoritative window identifier.

**This is a baseline, not a ceiling.** The protocol enforces no further constraint on `prompt_idx`, but the economics strongly reward miners who can predict which prompts will pass the validator's frontier checks for the current checkpoint:

- An `OUT_OF_ZONE` rejection wastes the 16 generations but is removed before GRAIL proof.
- A good picker puts more non-degenerate binary-reward groups into the proof queue. Coverage matters because only one proven winner can occupy each prompt, but there is no operator winner cap.

Techniques miners are expected to develop (non-exhaustive):

- A per-prompt success-rate estimate, updated online and reset (or decayed) whenever `checkpoint_n` advances.
- Clustering problems by difficulty or feature signature and sampling preferentially at the policy's current frontier.
- A cheap proxy (a smaller model, draft decoding, a few low-temperature samples) used only to predict frontier likelihood. Do not build a miner around brittle label/reward oracle tricks; current reward claims are verifier-checked, and future tasks may be private/generated.

The goal is to locate the *learning frontier* — prompts where the current policy succeeds on some attempts and fails on others. Every high-σ pick feeds the GRPO step a gradient-rich group instead of a wasted slot: miner optimization and training efficiency are aligned.

### Zone filter

The validator computes the population standard deviation σ of the verifier-checked rewards for your 16 rollouts. `σ ≥ 0.24` passes; `σ < 0.24` is rejected with `OUT_OF_ZONE`. During bootstrap (first `BOOTSTRAP_WINDOWS = 100` windows) the threshold is `σ ≥ 0.22`.

For OpenMath's binary `{0, 1}` rewards, this admits every non-degenerate group, k=1..15 correct out of 16. You cannot cherry-pick an easy prompt (16/16 correct → σ = 0) or fail on a hard prompt (0/16 correct → σ = 0). Both extremes are worthless for GRPO training. If a completion lacks a valid answer box, its observed reward remains zero but the group is admitted and ranked only if every binary interpretation of that off-format outcome remains eligible. The safest miner behavior is to preserve genuine sampled output and satisfy the boxed-answer instruction.

### Payment model

Earning is EMA-based, not flat per-submission. After each window the validator computes a per-hotkey reward share for the window, then updates each miner's score:

```
# One uniform slot per selected group across the whole v6 window.
share_this_window = selected_groups * (
    window_pool / (environment_count * picks_target * B_BATCH)
)
score_new = α × share_this_window + (1 − α) × score_old
```

where `α ≈ 0.027` (`EMA_ALPHA = 2 / (72 + 1)`). Once per subnet epoch (~360 blocks), the validator calls `set_weights` on-chain with these EMA values. Your emission for the epoch is proportional to your EMA score relative to other miners.

A miner may win multiple distinct prompt slots in one environment. Unused slots burn; completion length, boundary tier, and runner-up count do not change a selected group's payment. In v6 `rewarded=true` if and only if `selected_for_batch=true`.

See [docs/concepts.md](concepts.md#economic-model) for the full economic model.

### Rejection reasons

The validator emits one of the following reasons on every failed submission. Each is published per-submission in the window archive's `rejected[]` array (capped at 5 entries per hotkey per window). Definitions live in `reliquary/protocol/submission.py::RejectReason`.

**Rejected synchronously at HTTP enqueue (the `/submit` response carries the reason directly):**

| Reason | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `WINDOW_NOT_ACTIVE` | Window is in `TRAINING`, `PUBLISHING`, or `READY` — not accepting submissions | Sleep and re-poll `/state` until `state == "open"` |
| `PRECOMMIT_REQUIRED` | Collection closed and the body has no valid predeadline upload receipt | Upgrade the submitter; precommit the final serialized body before cutoff |
| `PRECOMMIT_INVALID` | Receipt, body hash/size, nonce, routing fields, or signature do not match | Reuse the exact serialized bytes associated with the receipt; never rebuild the body after precommit |
| `PRECOMMIT_EXPIRED` | The exact body did not finish inside the bounded reveal grace | Start finalization earlier or improve the upload path; do not increase generation after precommit |
| `MERKLE_ROOT_MISMATCH` | After the validator operator enables the calibrated gate, the signed wire-v1 root does not equal its byte-compatible recomputation | Use the repository's existing `_compute_merkle_root` output without altering its serialization |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | You exhausted the per-hotkey window quota: **512 attempts with V6 fill-closed enabled**, or **32 in V4/V5**. Other admission and proof-failure limits still apply | Throttle locally; the counter resets at every window boundary |
| `BATCH_FILLED` | The collection population, queue, or resource reservation is closed/full | Re-poll `/state`; if still open, back off and inspect validator capacity telemetry |
| `WINDOW_MISMATCH` | `window_start` in your request doesn't match the active batcher | Refresh `/state` and retry with the current `window_n` |
| `STALE_ROUND` | Your signed `drand_round` is older than the validator round at precommit/direct-body arrival. Backward tolerance is zero. | Compute the drand round immediately before final serialization and precommit, never at sketch-build time. |
| `FUTURE_ROUND` | (v2.3) Your `drand_round` field is newer than the validator's current round. Implies clock skew. | Ensure miner host is NTP-synced. Drand quicknet rounds advance on a fixed wall-clock schedule; sending a future round means your clock is ahead of UTC. |
| `PROMPT_FULL` | `MAX_SUBMISSIONS_PER_PROMPT = 10` pending groups already occupy this prompt | Pick a different prompt |
| `HASH_DUPLICATE` | Your operator already reserved this prompt or your tokens duplicate retained/recent content | Do not rotate hotkeys or replay a forced group; choose another prompt |
| `SEED_MISMATCH` / `PROTOCOL_MISMATCH` | The client does not advertise the active forced-seed protocol | Pull the current miner, rebuild, and confirm `protocol_version=6` and `generation_profile_id=qwen3-4b-base-dapo-reliquary-v1` |

**Rejected asynchronously by the worker (look up via `GET /verdicts/{hotkey}` or the R2 archive):**

| Reason | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `WRONG_CHECKPOINT` | `checkpoint_hash` does not match the active HF revision | Re-poll `/state`, update revision, retry. Most common transient reject — happens briefly after every new checkpoint publish. |
| `WRONG_RANDOMNESS` | `commit.beacon.randomness` doesn't match the validator's per-window seed (`state.randomness` on v2.3+; locally-derived `H(block_hash + drand)` on v2.2). Almost always caused by reusing a sketch built for an earlier window. | (v2.3) Read `state.randomness` from `/state` directly; do not re-derive locally. (v2.2) Derive per-window from chain + drand. In both cases: tag each sketch with the window it was built for and discard before firing if the window has advanced. |
| `BAD_PROMPT_IDX` | `prompt_idx` out of range for the active environment | Use the env's prompt-index space (`0..N-1`). v2.3 / OpenMathInstruct-2: `N ≈ 14_000_000`. |
| `PROMPT_IN_COOLDOWN` | `prompt_idx` was in the active cooldown set | v2.3: `BATCH_PROMPT_COOLDOWN_WINDOWS = 1_000_000` makes prompts effectively single-use. Read `cooldown_prompts[]` from `/state` **before each pick** and skip anything in the list. |
| `SUPERSEDED` | Historical only; current same-prompt competition resolves during continuous proof | Upgrade parsers that still expect the old runner-up flow |
| `OUT_OF_ZONE` | σ of your 16 rewards is below threshold (`SIGMA_MIN = 0.24` steady, `0.22` during the first `BOOTSTRAP_WINDOWS = 100` windows), or an uncertain off-format outcome can move the group out of zone | Pick a prompt with at least one success and one failure; always emit a valid boxed Math answer |
| `REWARD_MISMATCH` | OpenMath reward claim disagreed with recomputation, or a Code grader worker crashed ambiguously while handling the candidate | Recheck Math parsing; for Code, report repeatable crash-triggering output rather than retrying indefinitely |
| `GRAIL_FAIL` | A proved sketch differs from the validator forward pass beyond tolerance | Match checkpoint, tokenizer, attention/runtime stack, and proof construction exactly |
| `LOGPROB_MISMATCH` | Per-token log-prob deviation from validator's recompute exceeds `LOGPROB_IS_EPS = 0.10` | Same root cause as `GRAIL_FAIL` — quantization, attention kernel, or precision drift |
| `BAD_TERMINATION` | A rollout did not terminate naturally, hit the cap without EOS, or contains EOS padding/repeated stop-token tails | Confirm generation config matches protocol. Do not force `min_new_tokens`, suppress EOS, ride the 8192 cap, or append tokens after first EOS |
| `MALFORMED_FINAL_ANSWER` | A zero-reward Math completion ends in an empty, special-token, or unclosed answer box | Preserve genuine generation and emit one well-formed final box; do not append or cut answer markers |
| `DISTRIBUTION_SUSPICIOUS` | Near-duplicate completions carry opposite rewards in a pattern consistent with answer editing | Preserve the forced-seed outputs exactly; do not manufacture winners or losers by editing answer spans |
| `WRONG_ROLLOUT_COUNT` | Group has fewer or more than `M_ROLLOUTS = 16` rollouts | Always submit exactly 16 |
| `BAD_SCHEMA` / `BAD_TOKENS` | Submission payload malformed | Validate against the protocol schema |
| `PROMPT_MISMATCH` | Canonical prompt tokens for `prompt_idx` don't match the request | Re-derive prompt tokens from the env's deterministic mapping |
| `BAD_SIGNATURE` | GRAIL commit signature failed | Check wallet hotkey and signing code |
| `WORKER_DROPPED` | The batcher swapped before dequeue, or the Code grader had a retryable infrastructure outage. Grader-outage quota is refunded. | Re-poll and retry later; sustained events indicate validator backpressure or grader health problems |

`PROMPT_IN_COOLDOWN` is the most common **persistent** rejection caused by miner code: if your picker doesn't read `cooldown_prompts[]` before each pick, you will repeatedly submit prompts the validator has already cooled. Read the field — it's small and refreshes every `/state` call. The dashboard surfaces this directly on the miner drawer.

### Real-time verdict feedback (`/verdicts/{hotkey}`)

Under the production worker path `/submit` returns only `accepted=True reason="submitted"`. The first `/verdicts` result reports pool admission. The final result follows proof and selection. Identify it by non-null `selected_for_batch` and `rewarded`; do not treat the first `ACCEPTED` as a win.

The validator exposes the real per-submission verdicts via:

```
GET http://<validator-host>:<validator-port>/verdicts/{your_hotkey}?since=<unix_ts>
```

Response (`VerdictsResponse` in `reliquary/protocol/submission.py`):

```json
{
  "verdicts": [
    {"merkle_root": "ab12...64hex", "window_n": 1858, "accepted": true, "reason": "accepted", "ts": 1747353600.5},
    {"merkle_root": "ab12...64hex", "window_n": 1858, "accepted": true, "reason": "accepted", "selected_for_batch": true, "rewarded": true, "canonical_rank": 2, "ts": 1747353901.1},
    {"merkle_root": "ef56...64hex", "window_n": 1858, "accepted": false, "reason": "grail_fail", "accepted_into_pool": true, "selected_for_batch": false, "rewarded": false, "reject_stage": "auction_seal", "ts": 1747353902.0}
  ]
}
```

Properties:

- **Per-hotkey ring buffer** of the last `VERDICT_CAP_PER_HOTKEY = 200` verdicts. Older entries roll off silently.
- **Ordered by `ts` ascending.** Pass the highest `ts` you've seen as `?since=<ts>` to get only newer entries — strict `>` filter, so the same `ts` is excluded.
- **Empty list for unseen hotkeys** (200, not 404).
- **Public read.** Same trust model as the R2 archive; anyone can query any hotkey's verdicts.
- **Lock-free.** Doesn't compete with the submit worker for the batcher lock.

Recommended miner integration (~20 lines):

```python
last_seen_ts = 0.0

async def poll_verdicts(client, hotkey, validator_url):
    global last_seen_ts
    while True:
        try:
            r = await client.get(
                f"{validator_url}/verdicts/{hotkey}",
                params={"since": last_seen_ts},
                timeout=5.0,
            )
            for v in r.json()["verdicts"]:
                if v.get("selected_for_batch") is True:
                    logger.info(
                        "verdict WON win=%d rank=%s mr=%s",
                        v["window_n"], v.get("canonical_rank"),
                        v["merkle_root"][:12],
                    )
                elif v.get("selected_for_batch") is False and v["accepted"]:
                    logger.info(
                        "verdict NOT_SELECTED win=%d rank=%s mr=%s",
                        v["window_n"], v.get("canonical_rank"),
                        v["merkle_root"][:12],
                    )
                elif v["accepted"]:
                    logger.info(
                        "verdict POOL_ACCEPTED win=%d mr=%s",
                        v["window_n"], v["merkle_root"][:12],
                    )
                else:
                    logger.warning(
                        "verdict REJECTED win=%d mr=%s reason=%s",
                        v["window_n"], v["merkle_root"][:12], v["reason"],
                    )
                last_seen_ts = max(last_seen_ts, v["ts"])
        except Exception:
            pass
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
```

Log the fire-time response as `SUBMITTED`, the worker result as `POOL_ACCEPTED`, and only the final selected result as `WON`. A non-winner is ordinary competition, not a rejection or a reason to quarantine the model.

Polling is optional for protocol validity, but it is the authoritative live feedback path for selection outcome.

## Requirements

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| OS | Linux (tested on Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04) |
| Python | 3.11 or newer |
| GPU | 1x or 2x NVIDIA GPU, at least 24 GB VRAM each. Reference config: generation and proof on separate devices; one larger device also works. |
| CUDA | 12.x with `flash-attn`-compatible drivers |
| RAM | 32 GB minimum |
| Disk | 50 GB (model weights and HF cache) |
| Network | Stable outbound HTTPS to HF Hub and the active validator |
| Bittensor wallet | Created and registered on netuid 81 |

No R2 or S3 credentials are needed on the miner — only the validator uploads the window dataset.

### Inference runtime parity

Hardware speed is not the protocol contract; generation/proof numerics are.
Match the validator's pinned model, tokenizer, Torch, Transformers, attention
implementation, dtype, and optional-kernel set. The current validated stack is
Torch `2.7.0+cu128`, Transformers `5.9.0`, flash-linear-attention `0.5.0`, and
no `causal-conv1d`. Do not install a different fast-path kernel on miners alone:
that can increase miner-validator drift even when it improves throughput.

Different GPU models may still shift logits and GRAIL sketches. Use the runtime
fingerprint and final verdict telemetry to canary a new GPU type before scaling
it. Exact-CDF enforcement remains off because cached generation and full
teacher forcing are not bit-identical on every supported stack.

## Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url> reliquary
cd reliquary
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Verify:

```bash
reliquary --help
```

You should see `mine` and `validate` subcommands.

## Register your hotkey on the subnet

```bash
btcli wallet new-coldkey --wallet.name my_miner
btcli wallet new-hotkey  --wallet.name my_miner --wallet.hotkey default
btcli subnet register    --wallet.name my_miner --wallet.hotkey default --netuid 81
```

Confirm your hotkey appears in `btcli subnet metagraph --netuid 81` with a valid UID.

## Launch

> **Subnet-launch phase — `--validator-url` is required.**
> For the first weeks after subnet go-live, the subnet owner's validator will not yet hold enough stake to earn `validator_permit`, so the metagraph auto-discovery path (`discover_validator_url`) will raise `no validator with permit and routable axon`. Until the owner's hotkey gains the permit, you **must** pin the validator manually with `--validator-url`.

> Cross-check the axon IP advertised on-chain for this hotkey in `btcli subnet metagraph --netuid 81` before passing it to `--validator-url` — that confirms you are connecting to the real owner validator and not a look-alike.

```bash
# Both are required, and the miner refuses to start with only one of them.
export RELIQUARY_PROTOCOL_PROFILE=qwen3-4b-base-dapo-reliquary-v1
export RELIQUARY_EXPERIMENTAL_FILL_CLOSED_ENABLED=1

reliquary mine \
    --network finney \
    --netuid 81 \
    --wallet-name my_miner \
    --hotkey default \
    --checkpoint Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base \
    --environments openmathinstruct,opencodeinstruct \
    --validator-url http://<owner-validator-ip>:8888 \
    --log-level INFO
```

Once the owner validator earns `validator_permit`, you can drop `--validator-url` and the miner will auto-discover it from the metagraph.

The miner queries the validator at boot and downloads the current HF checkpoint automatically. You do not need to find or pin the checkpoint hash manually.

### Qwen3-4B Base / DAPO reasoning cutover (v5, carried into v6)

The model is `Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base` at the revision advertised in the generation contract. v5 was a hard prompt-protocol and training-lineage reset, and v6 keeps every part of it below unchanged — only the window regime differs. Protocol v4 is retained as the no-reasoning-cue control:

- Render the exact per-environment `prompt_template` advertised in `/state`, then tokenize it as raw text. Activating the chat template changes the prompt tokens and causes `PROMPT_MISMATCH`; do not add system, user, assistant, or `<think>` wrappers.
- Generate exactly 16 forced-seed rollouts at `temperature=1.0`, `top_p=1.0`, and `top_k=0`, with an 8192-token per-rollout cap and no BFT phase.
- Resolve the full EOS set from the pinned model/tokenizer generation configuration and stop at the first EOS.
- For OpenMath, retain the prompt's boxed-answer instruction and ensure the final reward-bearing answer is in a well-formed `\boxed{...}` or `\fbox{...}` span. Plain trailing numbers and `Answer:` lines score zero.
- Checkpoint downloads are sharded safetensors. Custom miners must download the complete pinned model and tokenizer snapshot rather than mixing files from another Qwen revision.

See [reasoning-prompt-v5-cutover.md](reasoning-prompt-v5-cutover.md) for the
exact prompts, fresh-base requirement, evaluation matrix, and activation gates.

### OpenCode mode

The live mixed rollout enables `opencodeinstruct` next to `openmathinstruct`.
OpenCode rewards are **validator-authoritative**: the validator owns the grader
and recomputes the code reward, so the miner only generates rollouts — it never
runs the grader. A miner that includes OpenCode just sets:

```bash
export RELIQUARY_ENVIRONMENTS=openmathinstruct,opencodeinstruct
```

Both miner and validator load the same public curated dataset
(`R0mAI/opencodeinstruct-curated`, pinned by default) **lazily** — only the
row-groups a window touches are fetched, so there is no bulk dataset download on
top of the model. The structured test cases are visible (the reward grades
genuine model output, not secrecy); the miner does **not** launch or require a
local OpenCode grader. Generate clean Python solutions and keep the same
GRAIL/logprob/termination rules as OpenMath. If your custom miner is not
code-ready yet, keep:

```bash
export RELIQUARY_ENVIRONMENTS=openmathinstruct
```

Additional flags:

| Flag | Default | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `--environments` | `openmathinstruct` | Comma-separated active miner environments. Use `openmathinstruct,opencodeinstruct` for mixed mining. |
| `--use-drand` / `--no-use-drand` | `--use-drand` | Turn off only for offline testing. Mainnet always uses drand. |
| `--validator-url` | *(auto-discovered)* | **Required during the subnet-launch phase** (see note above) and for local testing, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8888`. Once the owner validator (`5CXzFHfeiJ4Xkiirq4ej1MrRVCd789wEJXhpf2ZKRW6MNFJF`) holds `validator_permit`, leave empty and the miner will discover it from the metagraph. |

Environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RELIQUARY_ENVIRONMENTS` | `openmathinstruct` | Comma-separated environment list. Set to `openmathinstruct,opencodeinstruct` for mixed mining. |
| `RELIQUARY_OCI_REPO` | `R0mAI/opencodeinstruct-curated` | OpenCode dataset repo (public, curated). Override only to pin a fork. |
| `RELIQUARY_OCI_REVISION` | pinned commit | OpenCode dataset revision. Override only to pin a different snapshot. |
| `DRAND_CHAIN` | `quicknet` | Override only if drand announces a chain rotation. |
| `GRAIL_ATTN_IMPL` | `flash_attention_2` | Override to `eager` or `sdpa` in test envs without flash-attn. Do not override on mainnet. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PIPELINE_DEPTH` | `auto` | Screened groups that may wait for the proof GPU while the generation GPU starts the next prompt. `auto` is 1 with separate generation/proof GPUs and 0 (sequential) on one GPU. Queued groups are re-checked against live state before their proof. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_GENERATION_BACKEND` | `transformers` | `vllm` generates on vLLM (tested with 0.10.1.1 installed `--no-deps` beside torch 2.7.0; it needs numpy ≤ 2.2 for numba). The engine is built once with placeholder weights and runs in-process; every checkpoint, the first included, is copied into it from the proof model in about a second, with no rebuild and no disk re-read. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_RESERVE_GIB` | `2` | With the vLLM backend on a dedicated generation GPU, memory left free on `cuda:0`; vLLM takes the rest. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_SHARED_DEVICE_RESERVE_GIB` | `12` | Same, when vLLM shares its GPU with the proof model (room for the proof forward's full-sequence logits). |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PROOF_GPU_ENGINE` | `0` | With two GPUs and the vLLM backend, `1` runs a second vLLM engine on the proof GPU, in its own process (vLLM allows one in-process engine per process), and sends each prompt group to whichever engine is less loaded. The proof copy is idle most of the time; proofs project logits row by row, as the validator does, so a near-cap proof needs ~3 GB beyond the model instead of ~12. The second engine loads each activated checkpoint from its snapshot directory (about a second from page cache). If it fails to start, or cannot follow a checkpoint, the miner carries on with the first engine alone. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PROOF_GPU_ENGINE_RESERVE_GIB` | `12` | Memory the second engine leaves free on the proof GPU beyond what the proof copy already holds: a staged checkpoint during activation (~8 GB for a 4B model) plus one near-cap proof forward. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PROOF_GPU_ENGINE_GROUPS` | `auto` | Prompt groups on the second engine. `auto` scales a pinned `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_CONCURRENT_GROUPS` by the two engines' KV cache sizes, or sizes it like the first engine when that is `auto`; an integer pins it. The total is what the miner keeps in flight. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PROOF_GPU_ENGINE_START_SECONDS` | `900` | How long to wait for the second engine to come up before mining on the first alone. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_CONCURRENT_GROUPS` | `auto` | Prompt groups generating at once on the vLLM engine, so decode steps stay wide while one group's last rollouts finish. `auto` divides the KV cache vLLM allocated by 16 rollouts × the expected tokens per rollout below (bounded by `max_num_seqs / 16`); an integer pins it. In-flight groups are aborted when their window, randomness, checkpoint or admission lane changes, and a group is abandoned as soon as it has more rollouts without a stop token than the environment allows. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_EXPECTED_COMPLETION_FRACTION` | `0.12` | Expected completion length as a fraction of the environment cap, for `auto` sizing. Live rollouts at an 8,192 cap average about 400-900 completion tokens; on a 4090 with ~250k KV tokens this gives 10 groups. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_VLLM_EXPECTED_PROMPT_TOKENS` | `512` | Expected prompt length, for `auto` sizing. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_UNANIMOUS_DROP_ROLLOUTS` | `8` | Math groups (and code groups with public tests) generate 4 rollouts, then this many, before the rest; a prefix this long that is scored unanimously with no truncated or unboxed rollout is dropped as out of zone. A finished group is never dropped. `0` always finishes the group. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_ANSWER_SCREEN` | `1` | Stage validator-scored single-turn JSON-answer environments (`reliquary_logic_v2`) the same way, scoring each prefix locally with the pinned checker the validator runs on the decoded completion. Only clean rollouts can split a prefix (the validator values a truncated one at its worst case), and the full group must pass the same zone gate admission applies before it is proved. The claimed reward stays 0. `0` generates every logic group in full. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_YIELD_WEIGHTING` | `1` | Scale each open lane's pick weight by the kept groups per generation-second its environment has produced recently (decaying per window). A group is taken back when its final verdict pays nothing: out of zone, lane target already reached, batch filled, or prompt already proven. A lane that keeps losing the race therefore gets less generation time until it starts winning again. `0` keeps the plain mix. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_CHECKPOINT_PREFETCH_SECONDS` | `10` | Poll the advertised checkpoint repository's `main` head this often and download a new revision as soon as it appears, before validators advertise it (about a minute later). The pull at the window boundary then waits only for the load, or joins the download still in flight. `0` disables. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_PRUNE_CHECKPOINTS` | `1` | After each activation, delete cached revisions of the checkpoint repository written before the active one (about 8 GB each), keeping downloads in flight and the newest head. Other repositories in the Hub cache are untouched. `0` keeps every revision. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_CONCURRENT_UPLOADS` | `4` | Proved groups whose state recheck and upload (precommit, body, drand-boundary wait: typically 2–6 s) run at once. The proof GPU moves on to the next group instead of waiting for each upload. A validator `Retry-After` holds back every upload that follows it. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_LANE_VALUES` | empty | What one selected group pays in each lane, relative to the others, e.g. `openmathinstruct=2.66,reliquary_logic_v2=1`. The validator prices each environment separately and pays a fixed share per selected group, so a lane's value is its price. Pick weights become value × yield. A lane left out takes the mean of the listed ones. Empty weighs lanes equally. |
| `RELIQUARY_MINER_LIVE_LANE_PRICES` | `1` | Each window, read per-environment prices from the validator's `GET /tasks` and use them in place of `RELIQUARY_MINER_LANE_VALUES` (lanes are assumed to share one cap). A validator that does not publish `/tasks` is asked again every 30 minutes. `0` uses only the configured values. |

Remote prompt sources (OpenMathInstruct, OpenCodeInstruct) read every shard footer on first use, which takes one to two minutes. The miner builds them in background threads while vLLM starts and keeps a lane out of the mix until its source is ready. Each window it also prefetches the row-groups behind that window's prompt range (about 3 s each), and prompts are fetched off the event loop so polling and submission never wait on the Hub.

## What you should see

On a healthy startup:

```
... | Starting Reliquary miner (network=finney, netuid=81, envs=['openmathinstruct', 'opencodeinstruct'])
... | OpenCode miner: reward is validator-authoritative; skipping local grader launch.
... | Validator at http://x.x.x.x:8080 is on checkpoint 7 (your-org/reliquary-sn@abc123def...)
... | Downloading to seed the miner model.
... | Loading models from /home/.../.cache/huggingface/...
... | Miner ready. Entering main loop.
... | submitted window=42 prompt=4821 accepted=True reason=submitted
```

If submissions are rejected, the `reason` field tells you why (see the rejection table above).

## Monitoring and stopping

The miner loop runs until killed. It prefers `/miner-state` with conditional ETag requests and falls back to `/state` when unsupported. Outside OPEN it normally waits 1 second between polls; state-fetch failures wait `POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (10 seconds) after bounded HTTP attempts. The checkpoint identity is persisted locally and checked on restart. The verdict monitor runs independently of generation.

```bash
# GPU utilization during generation and proof construction.
nvidia-smi

# Submission results.
grep -E "submitted|rejected|accepted" ~/miner.log | tail -50
```

## Troubleshooting

- **`no validator with permit and routable axon`**: no active validator has published an HTTP endpoint on the metagraph. During the subnet-launch phase this is expected — the owner validator (`5CXzFHfeiJ4Xkiirq4ej1MrRVCd789wEJXhpf2ZKRW6MNFJF`) does not yet hold `validator_permit`. Pass `--validator-url http://<owner-validator-ip>:8888` to pin it explicitly (see [Launch](#launch)). After launch, wait for a validator to come back online or point at a known one.
- **CUDA out of memory**: v4 uses two Qwen3-4B model replicas and up to 16 concurrent 8192-token rollouts. Weight memory alone is not a capacity proof; activations and KV cache dominate as completions lengthen. Use separate generation/proof GPUs where possible and validate the exact hardware/runtime with representative near-cap groups before release.
- **`GRAIL_FAIL` / `LOGPROB_MISMATCH`**: your local proof compute diverged from the validator's. Most often caused by a different `attn_implementation` build, CUDA/torch version mismatch, or wrong checkpoint. Re-install on a clean environment and confirm you are on the same HF revision as the validator (check `/state`).
- **`REWARD_MISMATCH`**: for OpenMath, validator-side reward computation disagreed with the miner's claimed `rollout.reward`. For OpenCode it may also report an ambiguous grader worker crash. Recheck Math parsing or inspect repeatable crash-triggering Code output.
- **All submissions land `OUT_OF_ZONE`**: the prompts you are selecting are too easy (`sigma ~= 0`) or too hard (`sigma ~= 0`) for the current checkpoint. On OpenCode, this often means all-zero or all-pass structured-case vectors. Split metrics by environment before changing global filters.
- **Persistent `WRONG_CHECKPOINT`**: the miner is not picking up the latest revision from `/state`. Ensure the poll loop reads `checkpoint_revision` before each submission.

### Start-once verdict watcher

The updated `reliquary mine` command already monitors verdicts after its first
submission. No extra command is needed for that miner. Custom miners can run:

```bash
reliquary watch-verdicts \
  --validator-url http://62.238.81.36:8000 \
  --hotkey YOUR_PUBLIC_HOTKEY | tee -a verdicts.jsonl
```

Run once per hotkey, not per GPU or prompt. This requires a Reliquary version
containing the `watch-verdicts` command; check `reliquary watch-verdicts --help`.
It needs no private key, wallet, GPU or model load. It writes JSON lines and stops
with Ctrl-C. Warnings go to stderr. Do not run it alongside the built-in monitor
unless you intentionally want a second copy of the feed.

Both use the same cursor-based poller: one request at a time, every 5-6 seconds,
a reused HTTP client, two-second request timeout, and exponential backoff up to
60 seconds plus jitter on failures. Numeric Retry-After is honored up to 60
seconds. A successful poll resets backoff. Errors preserve the cursor. Normal
idle HTTP connections are reused; they do not represent queued mining work.

Extended fields require the corresponding validator rollout. Against an older
validator the watcher prints the available legacy fields. A missing
`selected_for_batch` is not false. Admission is not final selection, and selection
is not confirmation of trainer consumption or an on-chain payout. Read
`selection_status`, `outcome_code`, `proof_reason` and `reason_details` when present.

The watcher logs feed gaps/restarts; it does not automatically issue per-prompt
history requests or resend submissions. Save the JSON lines for support. Its
cursor is in memory: restarting resumes the server's bounded recent feed and can
repeat records or leave a historical gap. Use the targeted lookup documented in
[validator diagnostics](validating.md#detailed-miner-verdicts) when needed.

To recover stored final outcomes for an entire window (100 records per page):

```bash
reliquary watch-verdicts --validator-url http://62.238.81.36:8000 \
  --hotkey YOUR_PUBLIC_HOTKEY --window 45829 | tee window-verdicts.jsonl
```

This exits after the available pages; it makes no submission requests. Historical
windows before validator persistence was deployed cannot be reconstructed by this
command. A warning indicates a window whose final history is not marked complete.
