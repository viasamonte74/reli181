# on the seal-trigger race against honest single-instance miners).

#   1. ``Connection: close`` is set on every BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE
#      response, so the warm-up cannot happen (server tears the socket
#      down immediately; attacker pays handshake on the next packet).
#   2. This per-hotkey cap bounds bandwidth and verdict-ring noise even

#      the response is still BAD_ENVELOPE_SIGNATURE but the verdict is
#      no longer appended to the per-hotkey ring (which would otherwise
#      let a spoofer flood the victim's ``/verdicts/{hotkey}`` history
#      with junk that displaces legitimate entries).
#
# Crucially the per-hotkey rate-limit quota is never moved by these
# rejects, so PR #35's invariant holds end-to-end: an anonymous spoofer
# firing N bad packets against victim V's hotkey writes at most
# ``MAX_BAD_ENVELOPE_PER_HOTKEY_PER_WINDOW`` verdict-ring entries and
# burns N handshakes, but V's full legitimate quota is untouched.

# Conservative valuation of truncated rollouts (closes the manufactured-zero

# prompt looks harder. Measured on the live value function, one manufactured
# zero at k=6 is worth +68%. GPU tests showed this is NOT reliably detectable —
# an EOS-suppressed rollout looks like honest rambling, and any detector is
# farmable (a miner retries prompts until one evades).
#
# So price it instead of policing it: a truncated rollout has no gradeable

# --------------------
# The two reasons the tolerance was widened in earlier iterations are

#
#   * Worker-side dequeue lag (PR #31 → tol=10). The seal/drand re-check
#     used to run on the worker, minutes after arrival under GRAIL queue
#     backpressure. Removed by the arrival-time refactor — drand is now
#     checked only once at HTTP arrival, against the middleware-stamped
#     ``t_arrival``.
#   * RTT boundary crossing (commit 8b7f483 → tol=1). A miner firing at
#     t=2.99 s of round R would land at the validator at t=3.00 s of
#     R+1. Well-behaved miners are expected to apply a small boundary-
#     safety margin client-side and sleep past the boundary if their
#     corrected clock is within a few hundred ms of one. With both
#     sides NTP-synced and the miner respecting the safety window, no
#     honest submission should land in the wrong drand round.
#
# Submitted drand no longer participates in auction rank, but accepting an old
# round still weakens the signed freshness contract and makes replay analysis
# ambiguous. Keep this at zero. Cross-continent body upload is handled by the
# signed precommit/reveal grace, whose drand observation is fixed when the small
# precommit reaches the validator; widening this tolerance is not the transport
# fix.
# Tests pin specific values explicitly via
# ``GrpoWindowBatcher(drand_round_backward_tolerance=...)``.

# of times per forward. Sharing an interpreter with the event loop, which holds
# the GIL in long blocks to parse submission bodies and spawn admission
# workers, convoys it off the lock. Measured 2026-08-23 on an H100: the same
# forward costs 28.7 ms alone and 29.6 s against one CPU-bound python thread;
# in production the partial convoy showed up as 161 ms of wall time per
# forward, and 75% of a 139 s seal half.
#
# Every kernel, shape and dtype is identical to the in-process path, so no
# accept/reject decision can shift.
#
# The earlier note here said a second worker on one GPU measures x1.04 because
# the CUDA contexts time-slice, and that the replica MOVES so device memory is
# unchanged. The time-slicing is real — see PROOF_SLOTS_PER_DEVICE, which is
# what an MPS server fixes — but the move is not: nothing frees this process's
# pair, so isolation ADDS a replica. Measured on the live validator
# 2026-08-25: 31.4 GB in the main process (two replicas plus their allocator
# blocks, sm=0 across a full proof burst) beside 10.3 GB in the worker. See
# proof_worker.validator_replica_device, which now keeps this process's pair
# on the CPU whenever the plane is isolated.
#
# Off by default; the isolated plane requires the detached-trainer checkpoint
# intake, which is what stages a snapshot directory the worker can reload from.

# Proof processes per GPU. Isolation gave the proof interpreter its own GIL;
# slots give the card more than one interpreter feeding it.
#
# One proof costs 60 ms + 0.0145 ms/token — 87% fixed dispatch at the median
# v5 rollout — and the card idles at 39% utilisation while a single slot runs.
# Measured 2026-08-25 on an H100 PCIe over 192 real archived rollouts, the
# production stack and the production checkpoint:
#
#   slots      no MPS    with MPS
#       1      12.5 s      12.1 s
#       2       9.1 s       6.3 s
#       4       8.3 s       5.7 s
#       8           -       5.8 s   (plateau: the GPU is the limit here)
#
# Reproduced on a second H100 PCIe after three review rounds: 11.7 / 6.9 / 5.9
# at 1 / 2 / 4 slots, i.e. ~2x. Quote the range, not a third digit — the
# baseline moves a few percent between cards.
#
# Without an MPS server the CUDA contexts time-slice, which is the x1.04 the
# original isolation note recorded; with one they genuinely overlap. Every
# slot runs the same batch=1 path, and the whole matrix returned 192/192
# rollouts bit-identical on all_passed, sketch diff, p_stop, the seed
# counters, argmax ids and chosen probabilities — MPS included.
#
# Each slot holds its own replica: 10.2 GB, flat in rollout length (512 ->
# 8959 tokens moves peak allocation by 0.20 GB, because the proof path never
# materialises the [seq, vocab] block and chunks every vocabulary pass).
# Budget slots against free VRAM, not against the length distribution.
